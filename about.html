            <h1>About FouadTech</h1>
            <p><span class="intro-letter">F</span>ouadTech was started by a small group of students who were passionate about solving real-world problems using simple digital tools. Our mission is to help everyday people and businesses unlock their full potential.</p>

            <p>What makes us different is our hands-on approach. We design with the user in mind, and we never overcomplicate things. We work out of our dorms, living rooms, and cafes. Real people, real effort.</p>

            <p>Our founders met during their second year of university and realized they had a shared vision. That led to building our first app which... actually flopped. But that didnâ€™t stop us.</p>

            <p class="vision">Now, we focus on tools that actually help people. Things like schedule planners, digital inventory trackers, and small portfolio sites for artists and collectors.</p>
